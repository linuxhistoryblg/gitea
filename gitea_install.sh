I included the gitea binary in-line with the installation/configuration script so that the whole install could be done with one file. 

Unfortunately, this makes the file larger than the 25MB limit set by GitHub.

gitea_install.sh can be downloaded at:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MLb01Vsgm27hbwrp1c8eYebkwdGqncfs/view?usp=sharing

It is 137MB in size and has the following sha256 hash:
6fd4e820e56fc460d1c1099f54d54d0bfc069e4caec3a68430a7c65960e81569  install_gitea.sh
