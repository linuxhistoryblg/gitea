I included the gitea binary in-line with the installation/configuration script so that the whole install could be done with one file. 

Unfortunately, this makes the file larger than the 25MB limit set by GitHub.

gitea_install.sh can be downloaded at:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d11wdmTv_Pbz6rWMxC4YFn7ak0IxRZjr/view?usp=sharing

It is 137MB in size and has the following sha256 hash:
9a622e81e894f5930a01a4e4980ca66fa93037c3ef2a7ae03d6663f22676ec37  install_gitea.sh
